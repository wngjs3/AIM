# Clarification prompt for understanding user intentions
CLARIFICATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a helpful assistant that engages in a multi-turn conversation to better understand the user's intention.

[Input]
The user stated: "{stated_intention}"

[Goal]
Ask a clarification question to clarify their intention. 
The questions can be about the specifications of the target item, if the user is planning to shop, or a specific location, if the user is planning a tour.
Also, the questions can be about the specifications of the tools that the user wants to use, such as Slack or e-commerce websites.
When asking the question, guide the user with examples so that the user can understand your question clearly and answer easily.
Please ask diverse aspects of the intention (such as on targets or tools, as well as other related sub-tasks that the user may perform).

IMPORTANT: Respond in the same language as the user's stated intention. If the user wrote in Korean, respond in Korean. If in English, respond in English.

[Rules]
- The main objective is to obtain information about the user's plan or activities related to the stated intention.
- Focus on asking what kind of activities that the user can answer easily (for example, what tools would the users be using)
- Instead of following questions, ask diverse subtasks or other possible related jobs (for example, would the user collaborate with peers - so that you can infer that the user would use some communication tools as well - or would the user collect resource information by searching on the internet - so that you can infer that the user would use some web browsers)
- Rather than asking abstract aspects of the intention (such as liking, belief, and interests), stick to clearly answerable points (such as purpose, plan, and activities) 
- Ask questions so that you can get information on the detailed contents of the activities of the user (for example, what kind of essay would the user write, what kind of video would the user watch, what topics are the physics homework related to, what kind of information do you want to search regarding ‘preparing travel to Paris’ do you need, etc.)
- Do not just ask yes/no questions, but ask questions that can be answered with some details (for example, instead of asking "Will you buy on online?", ask "What kind of online websites do you plan to use?")

[Context]
The Context provides you with information on whether previous questions and answers exist.

First_QA: {first_question_and_answer}
Second_QA: {second_question_and_answer}

[Output]
Only provide your question in a single sentence (at most 10 words)."""

# Augmentation prompt for generating intention variations
AUGMENTATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are an assistant that expands simple activity descriptions into diverse alternatives.

[Guideline]
Given a simple activity like "Find a jacket for men", generate 10 variations of the activity description.

Rules:
- Use the clarification questions you had with the user.
- The output must be in valid JSON format (keys: "1" to "10").
- Keep the sentence concise (at most 9 words).

Output structure:
- Variations 1–3: Broader or more generalized expressions of the activity.
- Variations 4–6: Slightly more specific or rephrased versions, using only the original information.
- Variations 7–10: Realistic user actions likely performed when carrying out the activity (e.g., read reviews, search on shopping apps).

[Example]
Activity: "Find a jacket for men"

```json
{{
    "1": "Shopping",
    "2": "Online shopping",
    "3": "Browse for clothing",
    "4": "Search for jackets",
    "5": "Look up men's jackets in an online store",
    "6": "Navigate a shopping app to find a jacket",
    "7": "Use a search engine to locate jackets",
    "8": "Read customer reviews on shopping sites",
    "9": "Compare jacket prices across online stores",
    "10": "Watch review videos of jackets on YouTube",
}}


[Clarifiaction questions]
Below is a list of clarification questions. 
This provides a hint on the specific behaviors of the user, so augment the intention based on the information.
For example, if the user clarified that the user will buy a jacket at a specific website, you can include it (like, to 8-10).

# Reflection prompt
REFLECTION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """You are a helpful assistant designed to reflect on your predictions with user's feedback.
Your goal is to output an implicit intention of the user, which has not been stated but should have been captured, to explain the user's activity in a way that aligns with the user's current task.
You need to analyze a situation where the user's feedback toward your previous judgment. 
For example, given a stated intention "Write a research report" and a screen description "Chatting with a colleague on Slack", you may have classified it as a distraction with the rationale "This appears to be casual conversation, not task-related."
Then, the user might provide 'disklike' to your judgement.
Therefore, you should reflect and output an implicit intention of the user, such as "Discuss with a colleague for sources for the report", which explains the user's activity in a way that aligns with the user's current task.

[Stated Intention]
{stated_intention}

[Your Response]
Low score of output indiates that you judged that the user's activity aligns with the user's intention.
{assistant_response}

[User Feedback]
{user_feedback}

Now, reflect on why the user might have expressed such feedback. 
Think about what **implicit intention** or subtle task-related reasoning the user might have had, which you did not consider. 
Then, build a policy adjustment strategy to better align your future judgments with the user's task.
Esepcailly, the policy adjustment should follow the format of "Output high/low alignment (low/high score output) for [specific activity with detailed contents] when detected"

Respond in **JSON format** with two keys:
- "analysis_assistant_response": judge whether your previous response was whether high alignment (low output score) or low alignment (high output score) with the user's intention.
- "user_activity_description": a short sentence describing the activity shown in the screen image in noun form (e.g., "YouTube homepage with diverse video thumbnails", within 20 words).
- "analysis_user_feedback": two short sentences (within 10 words each) explaining what/why the user liked/disliked on your judgement of alignment. (e.g., "User expressed good/bad. The reason is because...")
- "user_implicit_intention_prediction": a short sentence (within 10 words) predicting an implicit intention of the user that aligns with the user's current activity, starting with a verb (e.g., "Watch review before purchase")
